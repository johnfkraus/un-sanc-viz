This group is linked to the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QE.T.14.01), to Al Mourabitoun (QE.M.141.14) and Ansar al-Shari&rsquo;a in Tunisia (AAS-T) (QE.A.143.14) with which it has worked closely. It also cooperates closely with Ansar al Charia Derna (QE.A.145.14).<br> </p> <p>On 11 September 2012, Ansar al Charia Benghazi took part in the attack against the Consulate of the United States in Benghazi, causing the death of four American citizens, including the Ambassador of the United States to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens. In 2012, the leader of Ansar al Charia Benghazi announced the group&rsquo;s support and adherence to the ideology of Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01).<br> </p> <p>Since 2012, Ansar al Charia Benghazi controls several terrorist training camps, mainly for the benefit of Al-Qaida-associated groups operating in Syria and Iraq and, to a lesser extent, in Mali. At least 12 of the 28 individuals involved in the In Amenas attack on the gas field of Tiguentourine (In Amenas, Algeria) by Al Mourabitoun and Al Mouakaoune Biddam (QE.M.139.14) in January 2013, were trained during the summer of 2012 in the camps run by Ansar al Charia Benghazi.
