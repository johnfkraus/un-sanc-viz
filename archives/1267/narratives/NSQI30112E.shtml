At some unspecified date, probably in April 2007, they left Germany for Yemen, and thereafter joined the IMU, integrating themselves permanently into its structures.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2008 Monir and Yassin Chouka and others recorded the video &quot;Good News from Afghanistan&quot;. In January 2009 they took part in the video &quot;Allah's Soldier Part 1&quot;. In April 2009 the video &quot;Victory or Shahada&quot; followed. In September 2009 appeared the fourth video, &quot;Merits of Jihad&quot;. In October/November 2009 both were involved in the video &quot;Abu<br> Safiyya in: He Came, He Saw, He Conquered&quot;.</p> <p>The video &quot;The Merits of Jihad&quot;, which had been announced in the previous video message &quot;Victory of Shahada&quot; as the sequel entitled &quot;Fadl al Jihad&quot;, shows a scene in which Yassin and Monir Chouka are sitting to the right and left of the leader of the IMU, Tohir Abdulkhalilovich Yuldashev(deceased). As reported in another IMU video that was secured on 24 November 2009 (&quot;Abu Safiyya in: He Came, He Saw, He Conquered&quot;) this person (Abu Safiyya) died on 17 October 2009. Both Monir and Yassin Chouka glorify his death as a martyr's death.</p> <p>The remarks of Yassin and Monir Chouka in the videos also show that they were aware of the ideology, goals, and methods of the IMU and by participating in the videos they made their own contributions within the organizational structure. Yassin and Monir Chouka put themselves in the service of the organization as multipliers, disseminating the organization's messages over the Internet and thereby inter alia recruiting new members or supporters.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p> Monir Chouka (QDi.300), listed on 25 January 2012</p>
