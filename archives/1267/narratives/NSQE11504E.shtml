It was led by extremist Abu Musab al-<br> Zarqawi, also known as Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased), who was killed in June 2006. Al-<br> Zarqawi had been operating independently in Iraq since mid-2003 using the name Jama&rsquo;at al-Tawhid<br> Wa&rsquo;al-Jihad (JTJ). Al-Zarqawi&rsquo;s group was responsible for the August 2003 bombing of the United<br> Nations Headquarters in Baghdad that killed at least 23 people, including United Nations Special<br> Envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello.</p> <p>JTJ, under Al-Zarqawi, established links to Al-Qaida (QDe.004). Al-Zarqawi had a long-standing<br> connection with the senior Al-Qaida leadership, appeared to be well regarded by them and was a<br> close associate of Usama bin Laden (deceased). He arranged for his followers to be trained in Al-<br> Qaida camps.</p> <p>Since his designation by the 1267 Committee, Al-Zarqawi moved the center of his operations to Iraq<br> and consolidated his group of operatives under JTJ. As the leader of JTJ, his ties to Al-Qaida,<br> however, remained, as evidenced by a letter intercepted in February 2004 that Al-Zarqawi wrote to Al-<br> Qaida/Usama bin Laden in Afghanistan, taking credit for various terrorist attacks.</p> <p>In October 2004 JTJ issued a statement pledging allegiance to Usama bin Laden, and undertook to<br> follow Bin Laden&rsquo;s orders. At this time the group also changed its name to Tanzim Qa&rsquo;idat al-Jihad fi<br> Bilad al-Rafidayn (the Al-Qaida Group in the Land of the Two Rivers, AQI). The group&rsquo;s stated aim is<br> the creation of a state in Iraq based on extremist ideology.</p> <p>Following Al-Zarqawi&rsquo;s death in 2006, Abu Ayyub al-Masri assumed leadership of AQI until his own<br> death in April 2010. The group continues to attack Iraqi civilians, the Iraqi Security Forces, and Iraqi<br> governmental institutions. It has claimed many terrorist attacks inside Iraq including the high-profile<br> attacks in Baghdad in August, October and December 2009, which, combined, killed over 480 people.<br> The group also claimed responsibility for the 2005 attack on three hotels in Amman, Jordan, which<br> killed at least 60 people.<br> </p> <p>Members of JTJ&rsquo;s precursor cell operating in Germany include Aschraf al-Dagma (QDi.132),<br> Ismail Abdallah Sbaitan Shalabi (QDi.128), Djamel Moustfa (QDi.129) and Mohamed<br> Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess (QDi.130).</p> <p>Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137) a.k.a Jabhat al Nusrah emerged publicly on 24 January 2012.
