MEVLT KAR</u></a></strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee's website</em>: 25 January 2012</p> <p>Mevlt Kar was listed on <strong>25 January 2012 </strong>pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 of resolution 1989 (2011) as being associated with Al-Qaida for "participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of" Islamic Jihad Group (QE.I.119.05). </p> <p><em>Additional information</em></p> <p>On the basis of police investigations, Mevlt Kar is under strong suspicion of having committed criminal acts, inter alia supporting the terrorist cell active in Germany around ringleader Fritz Martin Gelowicz (QI.G.259.08). In December 2006, Gelowicz, Adem Yilmaz (QI.Y.261.08), and Atilla Selek (QI.S.270.09), prosecuted in separate proceedings, joined together to form a terrorist cell in the Federal Republic of Germany. This cell belonged to the network of the Islamic Jihad Group (QE.I.119.05). Their object and goal was to commit attacks with explosives within Germany. Daniel Martin Schneider (QI.S.260.08) joined this cell in February 2007.</p> <p>The investigating judge at the German Federal Court of Justice has issued a warrant for the arrest of Mevlt Kar dated 17 August 2009, in connection with this, based on the strong suspicion inter alia of supporting a terrorist organization.</p> <p>Since leaving Germany in 2002, Kar has been living in Turkey. The connection to the German terrorist cell around the ringleader Gelowicz came about through his contact to Selek, who left for Turkey on 8 February 2007. The group planned for Selek to bring the detonators necessary for the attacks back to Germany, having been provided with them in Turkey.</p> <p>To procure the necessary detonators, Kar met with a &quot;Mityn&quot;, who has not been further identified, in Istanbul in April 2007. At that meeting, Kar took possession of a pair of shoes with 20 detonators concealed in their soles. Kar informed Selek of this, who in turn passed the information on to Gelowicz in Germany. After that, delays concerning the delivery of the 20 detonators from Turkey to Germany prompted Kar, to arrange an alternative delivery. On 17 July 2007 Selek informed Gelowicz of this and communicated to him that the &quot;replacement detonators&quot; were already on their way to Germany. According to instructions from Kar transmitted by Selek, Gelowicz drove on 3 August 2007 to Mannheim, Germany for the handover of the detonators. Gelowicz was given four mechanical and two electrical detonators during this handover. On 7 August 2007 Gelowicz confirmed to Selek that he had received the detonators and told him that more detonators would be needed in the next three weeks. Selek communicated this request to Kar, who then arranged the transport to Germany of the shoes with 20 detonators hidden in the soles already in his possession.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities</em></p> <p>Islamic Jihad Group (QE.I.119.05), listed on 1 June 2005</p> <p>Fritz Martin Gelowicz (QI.G.259.08), listed on 27 October 2008<br> Daniel Martin Schneider (QI.S.260.08), listed on 27 October 2008<br> Adem Yilmaz (QI.Y.261.08), listed on 27 October 2008<br> Atilla Selek (QI.S.270.09), listed on 18 June 2009</p>
