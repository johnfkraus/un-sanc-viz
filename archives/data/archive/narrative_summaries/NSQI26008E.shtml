Furthermore, the group procured the additional means needed for carrying out the attacks - such as, for instance, electrical devices for triggering the detonation - as well as several detonators. The manufactured explosives were to be placed in several vehicles and detonated in Germany outside discotheques and pubs frequented by citizens of the United States of America and/or at an airport, with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible.</p> Schneider was arrested on 4 September 2007 in Medebach, Germany and on 4 March 2010, the Higher Regional Court in Dsseldorf, Germany sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment for attempted murder while resisting law enforcement officers together with membership of a terrorist organization abroad, conspiracy to murder, causing an explosion, coercion of constitutional organs, as well as preparation of a serious criminal offence involving an explosion. <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p> Islamic Jihad Group (QE.I.119.05), listed on 1 June 2005</p> <p> Fritz Martin Gelowicz (QI.G.259.08), listed on 27 October 2008 <br> Adem Yilmaz (QI.Y. 261.08), listed on 27 October 2008<br> Mevlt Kar (QI.K.302.12), listed on 25 January 2012</p>
