At Fadhil's request, Ghailani obtained a cellular telephone to facilitate communications for the group responsible for the Dar es Salaam bombing. Fadhil, Khalfan Khamis Mohammed and the suicide bomber who drove the vehicle carrying the explosives, helped to prepare the bomb in July 1998. Muhsin Moussa Matwalli Atwah Dewedar (deceased), the bomb engineer, supervised and assisted the bomb assembly. Fadhil, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Msalam, Ghailani and other co-conspirators loaded boxes of explosives, detonators, and other bomb components into the Dar es Salaam bomb truck.
