In August 2008, Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman agreed to provide Top with funding for terrorist operations at a meeting with Top and Saefudin Zuhri, the main plotter of the 17 July 2009 bombings who is also deceased. Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman contacted his Saudi-based brother to request that he arrange for approximately $10,000 in cash to be passed to Top.
