DJAMEL MOUSTFA</u></a></strong> <br> </p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee's website</em>: 14 December 2009<br> </p> <p>Djamel Moustfa was listed on <strong>23 September 2003</strong> pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 1390 (2002), as being associated with Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden or the Taliban for "financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf or in support of" or "supplying, selling or transferring arms and related materiel to" Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04).<br> </p> <p><em>Additional information:</em> <br> Djamel Moustfa supported the German cell of the &quot;Al-Tawhid&quot; movement, listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04), based in Dsseldorf, Hamburg and other locations in Germany, from at least the summer of 2001 to 23 April 2002. The "Al-Tawhid" organization had close personal and organizational links to the Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01) network. Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased), a.k.a. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was the operational leader of the organization. Its main goals included securing a base of operations in Iraq from which it could launch terrorist attacks. The organization was responsible for the kidnapping and subsequent murder of civilians and the bombing of civilian targets, including the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003.<br> </p> <p>By September 2001, an independent "Al-Tawhid" cell had formed in Germany around Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess (QI.A.130.03). The cell worked in an insular and clandestine manner, mostly operating independently within the scope of directives from leaders abroad. It was an integral part of an international network which, among other things, ensured that Al-Qaida in Iraq received logistical and financial support.<br> </p> <p>Apart from Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess, members of the cell in Germany included Aschraf al-Dagma (QI.A.132.03) and Ismail Shalabi (QI.S.128.03). <br> </p> <p>The cell's activities in Germany consisted mainly of forging passports, collecting donations and facilitating the illegal cross-border travel of persons linked to the "Al-Tawhid" organization. However, there were also strong indications that, under the direction of Al-Zarqawi, the cell was planning to commit attacks in Germany. The plan was to use a pistol fitted with a silencer and a crate of hand grenades to carry out an attack on a busy square in a German town or city and to detonate hand grenades in another German town in the immediate vicinity of Israeli or Jewish property with the aim of killing as many people as possible. The attacks were supposed to be carried out by Ismail Shalabi together with other members of the cell, including Al-Dagma. The perpetrators targeted a Jewish community building in Berlin which they erroneously took to be a Jewish museum, and a bar and a discothque in Dsseldorf which they deemed, also by mistake, to be run or frequented by Jewish people. <br> </p> <p>Djamel Moustfa, who used the name "Mustafa" when he communicated with the organization and was known in the group as a passport forger and gun runner, was a close friend of Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess. He not only knew about the terrorist objectives of the group but supported them. <br> </p> <p>From autumn 2001 until his arrest on 23 April 2002, Moustfa had an important role in the passport forgery and procurement activities of the group. Abu Dhess used him to gain access to presumably forged passports in return for payment. Unidentified couriers were supposed to transport the passports to members of the organization still in Iran so that they could travel to safe third countries. A member of the group used his contacts with Moustfa to procure telephone cards for clandestine purposes.<br> </p> <p>In March and April 2002, Djamel Moustfa, acting on instructions, tried to procure at least one handgun with a silencer for the group through contacts in Essen and Hamburg. In addition, he declared his willingness to obtain suitable ammunition and numerous hand grenades. These weapons were to be used in a possible future attack. He knew these weapons were intended for a possible future attack by the group in Germany. <br> </p> <p>On 26 October 2005, Djamel Moustfa was convicted in Germany of supporting a terrorist group and was sentenced to five years in jail. Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess, Aschraf al-Dagma and Ismail Shalabi were convicted of plotting attacks and belonging to a terrorist organization. They were sentenced to up to eight years of imprisonment.<br> </p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em> <br> Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001 <br> Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04), listed on 18 October 2004<br> Ismail Abdallah Sbaitan Shalabi (QI.S.128.03), listed on 23 September 2003<br> Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess (QI.A.130.03), listed on 23 September 2003 <br> Aschraf al-Dagma (QI.A.132.03), listed on 23 September 2003</p>
