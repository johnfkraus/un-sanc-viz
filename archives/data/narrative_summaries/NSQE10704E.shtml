AL FURQAN</u></a></strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee's website</em>: 19 November 2010</p> <p>Al Furqan was listed on <strong>11 May 2004</strong> pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 16 of resolution 1526 (2004) as being associated with Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden or the Taliban for "participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf or in support of" or "otherwise supporting acts or activities of" the Armed Islamic Group (QE.A.6.01) and the Global Relief Foundation (GRF) (QE.G.91.02).</p> <p><em>Additional information: </em></p> <p>Al Furqan, a Bosnia-based non-governmental organization founded in 1997, has had close ties to the Bosnia branch of Al-Haramain Foundation (AHF), listed as Al-Haramain &amp; al Masjed al-Aqsa Charity Foundation (QE.A.109.04),<strong> </strong>and the Global Relief Foundation (GRF) (QE.G.91.02). </p> <p>Between 1999 and 2001, Al Furqan was under the financial control and acted on behalf of the Bosnia branch of AHF. During this time, Al Furqan received over 90 per cent of its total funding from the Bosnian branch of AHF. Al Furqan also conducted joint activities with AHF in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p> <p>Al Furqan has also provided support to the Bosnian branch of GRF, and shared an office in Sarajevo with GRF when GRF was active in Bosnia and Herzegovina. GRF, which initially operated in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the offices of another non-governmental organization, Taibah International-Bosnia Offices (QE.T.108.04), moved into the offices of Al Furqan in early 2000.</p> <p>Employees of Al Furqan have been involved in terrorist-related activities. One former Al Furqan employee had ties to the Armed Islamic Group (QE.A.6.01). In addition, in 2000, three employees of Al Furqan conducted surveillance of the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo, and two individuals affiliated with Al Furqan were detained in May 2001 after they had videotaped the building and security personnel of the United Nations Representative Office in Sarajevo.</p> <p>Although Al Furqan de-registered with the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 2002, two NGOs continued to act on Al Furqan's behalf. Sirat, also known as "the Association for Education Culture and Building Society," registered with the Government Bosnia and Herzegovina in December 2002 at Al Furqan's former office address. Al Furqan transferred its assets to Sirat, which was founded to act as a successor organization to Al Furqan. The former director of Al Furqan's operations in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, founded Istikamet in April 2003. As of late 2003, Istikamet maintained Al Furqan's programs, leadership and at least some of its assets in the Zenica area. Both Sirat and Istikamet are listed as a.k.a.s of Al Furqan.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Armed Islamic Group (QE.A.6.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Global Relief Foundation (GRF) (QE.G.91.02), listed on 22 October 2002<br> Taibah International-Bosnia Offices (QE.T.108.04), listed on 11 May 2004<br> Al-Haramain &amp; al Masjed al-Aqsa Charity Foundation (QE.A.109.04), listed on 28 June 2004</p>
