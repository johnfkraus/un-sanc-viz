It distinguished itself from other groups operating in Algeria by its indiscriminate targeting of intellectuals and other civilians. </p> <p>Prominent Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01) figures, such as United Kingdom-based Omar Mahmoud Uthman (QI.M.31.01), a.k.a. Abu Qatada, and Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, aka Abu Musab al-Suri, served as editors for the GIA newsletter, Al-Ansar, during the mid-1990s. This pamphlet was the most significant extremist publication at that time. In 1997, Mostafa Kamel Mostafa Ibrahim (QI.I.67.02), a.k.a. Abu Hamza, became editor-in-chief of Al-Ansar. Abu Hamza also served as the group's unofficial spokesman during the 1998 Ramadan massacres' in Algeria.</p> <p>The Algerian diaspora in Europe, particularly in France, has been a source of GIA financial support and recruitment. France has also been a target of GIA attacks.</p> <p>GIA has been involved in a number of terrorist acts, including hijacking, bombing civilian sites, attacking civilians and ambushing Algerian security forces. Between 1992 and 2002, GIA reportedly killed more than 100 foreigners, mostly Europeans, in Algeria.</p> <p>GIA's terrorist activities include:</p> <ul> <li><span dir="LTR">hijacking an Air France flight in Algiers in December 1994 with the intention of crashing it over Paris; one passenger was executed by the GIA; </span></li> <li><span dir="LTR">a series of bombings in France in 1995 which killed 10 people and injured more than 200 on subways in Paris, at outdoor markets, at a Jewish school, and against a high-speed train. Several GIA members were convicted in France for these crimes in late 1999;</span></li> <li><span dir="LTR">kidnapping and assassinating 7 monks from the monastery of Tibehirine, Algeria, in 1996;</span></li> <li><span dir="LTR">assassinating the Catholic Bishop of Oran, Algeria, a proponent of inter-faith dialogue, in 1996;</span></li> <li><span dir="LTR">bombing a market place in Larbaa, Algeria, on 5 July 2002 (Algerian Independence Day) in which 35 people died;</span></li> <li><span dir="LTR">massacres of entire villages and families between 1995 and the late 1990s, killing several hundred people.</span></li> </ul> <p>In 1998, GIA split over the issue of attacking civilians. One of its commanders, Hassan Hattab, broke away to found the Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC), listed as the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QE.T.14.01).
