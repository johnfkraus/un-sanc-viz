He has pledged an oath of loyalty to AQAP emir Nasir al-Wahishi (QI.A.274.10), and has played a key role in setting the strategic direction for AQAP. Al-Aulaqi has also recruited individuals to join AQAP, facilitated training at camps in Yemen in support of acts of terrorism, and helped focus AQAP's attention on planning attacks beyond the Arabian Peninsula. </p> <p>Since late 2009, Al-Aulaqi has taken on an increasingly operational role in the group, including preparing Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab for his attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight traveling between Amsterdam and Detroit on 25 December 2009. In November 2009, while in Yemen, Abdulmutallab swore allegiance to the emir of AQAP and shortly thereafter received instructions from Al-Aulaqi to detonate an explosive device aboard a U.S. airplane over U.S. airspace. After receiving this direction from Al-Aulaqi, Abdulmutallab obtained the explosive device he used in the attempted attack. </p> <p>Al-Aulaqi was imprisoned in Yemen in 2006 on charges of kidnapping for ransom and being involved in an Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01) plot to kidnap a U.S. official, but was released in December 2007 and subsequently went into hiding in Yemen. </p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) (QE.A.129.10), listed on 19 January 2010<br> Nasir abd-al-Karim Abdullah al-Wahishi (QI.A.274.10), listed on 19 January 2010<br> Said Ali al-Shihri (QI.A.275.10), listed on 19 January 2010<br> Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Rimi (QI.A.282.10), listed on 11 May 2010<br> Ibrahim Hassan Tali al-Asiri (QI.A.291.11), listed on 24 March 2011<br> Othman Ahmed Othman al-Ghamdi (QI.A.292.11), listed on 16 June 2011</p>
