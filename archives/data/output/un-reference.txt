Consolidated United Nations Security Council Sanctions List

The Consolidated List includes all individuals and entities subject to sanctions measures imposed by the Security Council. The inclusion of all names on one Consolidated List is to facilitate the implementation of the measures, and neither implies that all names are listed under one regime, nor that the criteria for listing specific names are the same. For each instance where the Security Council has decided to impose sanctions in response to a threat, a Security Council Committee manages the sanctions regime. Each sanctions committee established by the United Nations Security Council therefore publishes the names of individuals and entities listed in relation to that committee as well as information concerning the specific measures that apply to each listed name.

The current version of the Consolidated List is provided in .xml, .html and .pdf formats. Member States are obliged to implement the measures specific to each listed name as specified on the websites of the related sanctions committee.

Composition of the List

The Consolidated List consists of two sections, specified below:

Individuals (618 individuals)
Entities and other groups (421 entities)
Individuals are listed alphabetically by their names as it appears in Latin script. Entities are also arranged in alphabetical order. Narrative summaries of reasons for listing, where available, can also be found on the respective Committees’ webpage. Members States are strongly encouraged, wherever possible, to submit to the concerned Committee, through their Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York, any relevant information not currently included on the Sanctions Lists.

The Consolidated list maintained on this website was last updated on 26 October 2014, and supersedes all previous versions. A press release is issued after all changes to the respective sanctions list and is posted in the "Press releases" section of the concerned Committee.

Identifiers and acronyms in the list

The Consolidated Sanctions List has several identifying fields. Where information is lacking, the letters "na" (not available) denote that the Committee has not yet been able to obtain it. Explanations of the fields are provided below.

Individuals

Permanent reference number: indicate which sanctions regime concerns respective names, for example, permanent reference numbers starting with “QD” refer to the Al-Qaida Sanctions regime whereas permanent reference numbers starting with CF refer to names listed under the Security Council sanctions regime concerning the Central African Republic. For countries, the letters are chosen based on the 2 digit country ISO codes. The following letter “i” refers to individuals and “e” to entities (kindly see the table below).
