To further conceal the true ownership of the Falcon-50 jet, Hasan Ahmed S. Adnan, an Iraqi aircraft technician, was listed as its owner. Recognizing the former Iraqi regime's interest in the aircraft, Liechtenstein authorities recently deregistered the jet and initiated liquidation proceedings against its legal proprietor, Aviatrans.
