One example of the relationship between the former Government of Iraq and Iraqi Airways Company was the payment of legal expenses and costs associated with litigation in the United Kingdom between Iraqi Airways Company and Kuwaiti Airways, by the former Government of Iraq. Landau and Scanlon (legal representative of Iraqi Airways Company) have not contested, nor intend to contest the legitimacy of the Iraqi Airways Company listing on the Bank of England financial sanctions Web site, as an entity of the former Government of Iraq under the provisions of paragraph 23 of Security Council resolution 1483. This fact in itself incontrovertibly supports the view that the Iraqi Airways Company were/are a State-run entity of the former Iraqi Government.<br> Further evidence of the former Government of Iraq&rsquo;s control over Iraqi Airways Company can be found at the appropriate entry for the entity held by the Arab Air Carriers Organization, which lists the company as &ldquo;public sector owned&rdquo;. The World Tourism Organization describes the company as &ldquo;a national governmental company&rdquo;. The company also established sales offices in the Middle East.<br> Security Council resolution 661 (1990) decided that all United Nations Member States should &ldquo;not make available to the Government of Iraq, or to any commercial, industrial or public entity undertaking in Iraq or Kuwait, or any funds or other financial or economic resources...&rdquo;. A number of Member States seized several aircraft belonging to the Iraqi Airways Corporation, as required by resolution 661 (1990). These aircraft remain frozen by Member States pending their return to Iraq as required by Security Council resolution 1483 (2003). <br> There is therefore sufficient evidence to support the inclusion of Iraqi Airways Company on the list of entities established pursuant to paragraphs 19 and 23 of Security Council resolution 1483 (2003).&rdquo; </p>            <p>  </p>
