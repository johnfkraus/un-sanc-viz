According to the document, Runiga's appointment was prompted by the need to ensure the visibility of the M23 cause. Runiga is named as the 'President' of the M23 in postings on the group's website. His leadership role is corroborated by the November 2012 Group of Experts report, which refers to Runiga as the 'leader of the M23'. According to a December 13, 2012 Associated Press article, Runiga showed the Associated Press a list of demands that he said will be presented to the Congolese government. Included in the demands are the resignation of Kabila and the dissolution of the national assembly. Runiga indicated that if given the opportunity, M23 could retake Goma. "And at this time we will not retreat," Runiga told the Associated Press. He also indicated that M23's political branch should resume its control of Goma as a precondition to negotiations. "I think our members who are in Kampala represent us. In due time I will be there, too. I am waiting for things to be organized and when Kabila will be there, I will go, too," Runiga said. According to a November 26, 2012 Le Figaro article, Runiga met with DRC President Kabila on November 24, 2012 to begin discussions. Separately, in an interview with Le Figaro, Runiga stated, "M23 is composed primarily of former FARDC military members who defected to protest the non-respect of the March 23, 2009 accords." He added, "M23's soldiers are deserters from the army who left with their arms in hand. Recently, we recovered a lot of equipment from a military base in Bunagana. For the moment, this allows us to regain territory each day and to repel all the attacks from the FARDC.Our revolution is Congolese, led by the Congolese, for the Congolese people." According to a November 22, 2012 Reuters article, Runiga stated that M23 had the capacity to hang on to Goma after M23's forces were bolstered by mutinying Congolese soldiers from the FARDC: "Firstly we have a disciplined army, and also we have the FARDC soldiers who've joined us. They're our brothers, they'll be retrained and recycled then we'll work with them." According to a November 27, 2012 article published in The Guardian, Runiga indicated that M23 would refuse to obey a call by regional leaders of the International Conference of the Great Lakes to leave Goma in order to pave the way for peace talks. Instead, Runiga stated that M23's withdrawal from Goma would be the result, not a precondition, of negotiation. According to the 15 November 2012 Final Report of the Group of Experts, Runiga led a delegation that travelled to Kampala, Uganda on July 29, 2012 and finalized the M23 movement's 21-point agenda ahead of anticipated negotiations at the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region. According to a November 23, 2012 BBC article, M23 was formed when former members of the CNDP who had been integrated into the FARDC began to protest against bad conditions and pay, and lack of full implementation of the March 23, 2009 peace deal between the CNDP and the DRC that led to the CNDP's integration into the FARDC. M23 has been engaged in active military operations in order to take control of territory in eastern DRC, according to the November 2012 IPIS report. M23 and FARDC fought over control of several towns and villages in eastern DRC on July 24 and July 25, 2012; M23 attacked the FARDC in Rumangabo on July 26, 2012; M23 drove FARDC from Kibumba on November 17, 2012; and M23 took control of Goma on November 20, 2012. According to the November 2012 Group of Experts report, several ex-M23 combatants claim that M23 leaders summarily executed dozens of children who attempted to escape after being recruited as M23 child soldiers. According to a September 11, 2012 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), a Rwandan man, 18, who escaped after being forcibly recruited in Rwanda told HRW that he witnessed the execution of a 16-year old boy from his M23 unit who had tried to flee in June. The boy was captured and beaten to death by M23 fighters in front of the other recruits. An M23 commander who ordered his killing then allegedly told the other recruits "[h]e wanted to abandon us," as an explanation for why the boy had been killed. The report also states that witnesses claimed that at least 33 new recruits and other M23 fighters were summarily executed when they attempted to flee. Some were tied up and shot in front of other recruits as an example of the punishment they could receive. One young recruits told HRW, "[w]hen we were with M23, they said [we had a choice] and could stay with them or we could die. Lots of people tried to escape. Some were found and then that was immediately their death. Entered the Republic of Rwanda on 16 March 2013, at Gasizi / Rubavu."</p> <h2> </h2>      <p>  </p>
