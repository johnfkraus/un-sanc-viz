Col. Eric Badege had become the focal point of M23 in Masisi and commanded joint operations..." with another military leader. Additionally, "a series of coordinated attacks carried out in August [2012] by Lt. Col. Badege...enabled M23 to destabilize a considerable part of Masisi territory." "According to former combatants, Lt Col. Badege...acted under the orders of Col. Makenga when he orchestrated the attacks. As a military commander of M23, Badege is responsible for serious violations involving the targeting of children or women in situations of armed conflict. According to the November 2012 Group of Experts report, there have been several major incidents of indiscriminate killings of civilians, including women and children. Since May 2012 Raia Mutomboki, under the command of M23, have killed hundreds of civilians in a series of coordinated attacks. In August, Badege carried out joint attacks which involved the indiscriminate killing of civilians. The November Group of Experts report states that these attacks were jointly orchestrated by Badege and Colonel Makoma Semivumbi Jacques. According to the Group of Experts Report, local leaders from Masisi stated that Badege commanded these Raia Mutomboki attacks on the ground. According to a July 28, 2012, Radio Okapi article, "the administrator of Masisi announced this Saturday, July 28th, the defection of the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 410th Regiment FARDC base Nyabiondo, about thirty kilometers northwest of Goma in North Kivu. According to him, Colonel Eric Badege and more than a hundred soldiers headed Friday to Rubaya, 80 kilometers north of Nabiondo. This information has been confirmed by several sources." According to a November 23, 2012 BBC article, M23 was formed when former members of the CNDP who had been integrated into the FARDC began to protest against bad conditions and pay, and lack of full implementation of the March 23, 2009 peace deal between the CNDP and the DRC that led to the CNDP's integration into the FARDC. M23 has been engaged in active military operations in order to take control of territory in eastern DRC, according to the November 2012 IPIS report. M23 and FARDC fought over control of several towns and villages in eastern DRC on July 24 and July 25, 2012; M23 attacked the FARDC in Rumangabo on July 26, 2012; M23 drove FARDC from Kibumba on November 17, 2012; and M23 took control of Goma on November 20, 2012. According to the November 2012 Group of Experts report, several ex-M23 combatants claim that M23 leaders summarily executed dozens of children who attempted to escape after being recruited as M23 child soldiers. According to a September 11, 2012 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), a Rwandan man, 18, who escaped after being forcibly recruited in Rwanda told HRW that he witnessed the execution of a 16-year old boy from his M23 unit who had tried to flee in June. The boy was captured and beaten to death by M23 fighters in front of the other recruits. An M23 commander who ordered his killing then allegedly told the other recruits "[h]e wanted to abandon us," as an explanation for why the boy had been killed. The report also states that witnesses claimed that at least 33 new recruits and other M23 fighters were summarily executed when they attempted to flee. Some were tied up and shot in front of other recruits as an example of the punishment they could receive. One young recruit told HRW, "[w]hen we were with M23, they said [we had a choice] and could stay with them or we could die. Lots of people tried to escape. Some were found and then that was immediately their death."</p> <h2> </h2>      <p>  </p>
