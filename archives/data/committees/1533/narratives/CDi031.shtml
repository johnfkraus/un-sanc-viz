The UNSC DRC Sanctions Committee's Group of Experts reported that Lt Col Innocent Zimurinda was witnessed first-hand refusing to release three children from his command in Kalehe, on August 29, 2009. According to multiple sources, Lt Col Innocent Zimurinda, prior to the CNDP's integration into FARDC, participated in a November 2008 CNDP operation that resulted in the massacre of 89 civilians, including women and children, in the region of Kiwanja. In March 2010, 51 human rights groups working in eastern DRC alleged that Zimurinda was responsible for multiple human rights abuses involving the murder of numerous civilians, including women and children, between February 2007 and August 2007. Lt Col Innocent Zimurinda was accused in the same complaint of responsibility for the rape of a large number of women and girls. According to a May 21, 2010, statement by the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict, Innocent Zimurinda has been involved in the arbitrary execution of child soldiers, including during operation Kimia II. According to the same statement, he denied access by the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC) to screen troops for minors. According to the UNSC DRC Sanctions Committee's Group of Experts, Lt Col Zimurinda holds direct and command responsibility for child recruitment and for maintaining children within troops under his command. Integrated in the FARDC in 2009 as a Lieutenant Colonel, brigade commander in FARDC Kimia II Ops, based in Ngungu area. In July 2009, Zimurinda was promoted to full Colonel and became FARDC Sector commander in Ngungu and subsequently in Kitchanga in FARDC Kimia II and Amani Leo Operations. Whereas Zimurinda did not appear in the 31 December 2010 DRC Presidential ordinance nominating high FARDC officers, Zimurinda de facto maintained his command position of FARDC 22nd sector in Kitchanga and wears the newly issued FARDC rank and uniform. He remains loyal to Bosco Ntaganda. In December 2010, recruitment activities carried out by elements under the command of Zimurinda were denounced in open source reports.
