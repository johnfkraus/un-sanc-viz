The UN identified Chichakli as Viktor Bout's Chief Financial Manager and, therefore, as one who acts at Bout's direction. His own resume details his senior positions with several Bout-controlled companies. A certified public accountant and certified fraud examiner with more than 12 years of experience, plays a significant role in assisting Bout in setting up and managing a number of his key firms and moving money (both for acquisition of assets and reparation of profits). In media interviews, reportedly has held himself out as spokesperson for Viktor Bout and his network. Chichakli is an officer of San Air General Trading. Payments for many of the weapons that went to Liberia through Victor Bout's network in 2000 and 2001 were directed to San Air's bank accounts. As such, Chichakli is associated with an entity providing financial or military support to armed rebel groups in Liberia or in countries in the region. </p> <h2> </h2>      <p>  </p>
