Al-Asiri acts as the principal bomb maker for AQAP and is currently believed to be hiding in Yemen. </p> <p>Before joining AQAP, Al-Asiri was part of an Al-Qaida-affiliated (QDe.004) terrorist cell in Saudi Arabia and was involved in planned bombings of oil facilities in the Kingdom. In 2006 Al-Asiri was arrested by the Saudi police and imprisoned for nine months for trying to enter Iraq to join a militant group there. Upon his release, Al-Asiri attempted to create a new militant cell inside Saudi Arabia; however, police raided its meeting place and six of his colleagues were killed while he and his brother Abdullah fled to Yemen. Soon afterwards, Al-Asiri joined AQAP and has continued to engage in terrorist activity. </p> <p>Al-Asiri encouraged his brother Abdullah to participate in AQAP activity. In August 2009, Abdullah carried out a suicide attack when he detonated a bomb concealed within his body with the intent to assassinate the Assistant Minister for Security Affairs of Saudi Arabia. Although the assassination attempt failed, the plot demonstrated a high level of sophistication on the part of AQAP. Ibrahim al-Asiri is credited with designing the bomb, which contained one pound of explosives. Later, AQAP released a video of Ibrahim al-Asiri and his brother Abdullah in which an AQAP commander stated that Ibrahim al-Asiri had also wanted to perpetrate a suicide attack but had to be kept behind to oversee the mission of Abdullah.</p> <p>A Saudi Arabian citizen, in 2009 Al-Asiri was added to the Saudi most wanted terrorist list, and an INTERPOL Orange Notice was distributed worldwide. The notice was submitted as a global alert and as a request to locate Al-Asiri who posed a dangerous threat, concerning terrorism-related activities including but not limited to those undertaken on behalf of AQAP.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) (QDe.129), listed on 19 January 2010</p> <p>Nasir 'Abd-al-Karim 'Abdullah al-Wahishi (QDi.274), listed on 19 January 2010<br> Said Ali al-Shihri (QDi.275), listed on 19 January 2010<br> Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Rimi (QDi.282), listed on 11 May 2010<br> Anwar Nasser Abdulla al-Aulaqi (QDi.283), listed on 20 July 2010<br> Othman Ahmed Othman al-Ghamdi (QDi.292), listed on 16 June 2011</p>
