Members of the group included Mohamed el Amir Awad Elsayed Atta, Marwan Yousef Mohamed Rashed Alshehhi and Ziad Samir Jarrah, who conducted and died in terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 in the United States of America, and Said Bahaji (QDi.080), Ramzi Mohamed Abdullah Binalshibh (QDi.081) and Mounir el Motassadeq (QDi.082). </p> <p>Zakarya Essabar provided assistance to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) for the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States of America. Zakarya Essabar, together with El Motassadeq and Jarrah, was present at meetings held at an apartment rented jointly by Atta, Bahaji and Binalshibh in Hamburg, Germany, that served as the operational base for the group, and where Alshehhi also lived for some time.</p> <p>By November 1999, a structured group emerged under the leadership of Atta, comprising also the persons referred to above; the members of this group were willing to launch attacks particularly against "Americans and Jews". The members of the group resolved to undertake the initial steps towards planning and executing envisaged attacks. Subsequent to attending Al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan, where they sought military training, they intended to commit major attacks involving explosives. </p> <p>In line with their plans and between mid-November 1999 and the beginning of December 1999, Atta, Alshehhi, Binalshibh and Jarrah traveled via Pakistan to an Al-Qaida camp in Afghanistan. Within Al-Qaida plans had already been made to commit attacks in the United States of America using airplanes as weapons. Within a short space of time, Atta, Alshehhi, Jarrah and Binalshibh were recruited by Usama bin Laden (deceased) and other Al-Qaida leaders to take part as pilots in these attacks. They returned to Germany at the beginning of 2000 and began to prepare for the attacks to take place on 11 September 2001.</p> <p>In January 2000 Zakarya Essabar went, by agreement with the other members of the group, to an Al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan. He returned from Afghanistan to Germany at the end of August 2000. After Binalshibh had tried unsuccessfully on several occasions to obtain an entry visa for the United States of America in order to undergo training as a pilot with Jarrah, Zakarya Essabar was supposed to take his place during the intended attacks. For this reason, he made two applications, on 12 December 2000 and on 28 January 2001, for a residence visa for the United States of America; both were rejected. On 30 August 2001, by agreement with Binalshibh and Bahaji, Zakarya Essabar went to an Al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The authorities of Germany issued an arrest warrant for Zakarya Essabar on 18 October 2001 charging him, amongst other things, with murder and manslaughter. </p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Said Bahaji (QDi.080), listed on 30 September 2002<br> Ramzi Mohamed Abdullah Binalshibh (QDi.081), listed on 30 September 2002<br> Mounir el Motassadeq (QDi.082), listed on 30 September 2002<br> </p>
