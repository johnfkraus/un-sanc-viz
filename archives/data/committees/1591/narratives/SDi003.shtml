<!-- http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1591/SDi003.shtml --><p>In accordance with Section 5 (g) of its Guidelines, the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan makes accessible a narrative summary of reasons for the listing for individuals and entities included in the sanctions list.</p> <p><strong>SDi.003 </strong><strong>Adam Yacub SHARIF</strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee&rsquo;s website</em>: 29 October 2014</p> <p>Sharif was listed on 25 April 2006 by paragraph 1 of resolution 1672 (2006) as &ldquo;Sudanese Liberation Army Commander&rdquo;.</p> <p><br> <em>Additional information</em></p> <p>SLA soldiers under the command of Adam Yacub Shant violated the ceasefire agreement by attacking a Government of Sudan military contingent that was escorting a convoy of trucks near Abu Hamra, Northern Darfur on July 23, 2005, killing three soldiers. After the attack Government military weapons and ammunition were looted. The Panel of Experts has information establishing that the attack by SLA soldiers took place and was clearly organized; consequently it was well planned. It is therefore reasonable to assume, as the Panel concluded, that Shant, as the confirmed SLA Commander in the area, must have had knowledge of and approved / or ordered the attack. He therefore bears direct responsibility for the attack and meets the criteria for being listed. </p> <h2> </h2>      <p>  </p>
