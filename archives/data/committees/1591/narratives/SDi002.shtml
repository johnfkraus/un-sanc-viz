<!-- http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1591/SDi002.shtml --><p>In accordance with Section 5 (g) of its Guidelines, the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan makes accessible a narrative summary of reasons for the listing for individuals and entities included in the sanctions list.</p> <p><strong>SDi.002 </strong><strong>Musa Hilal Abdalla ALNSIEM</strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee&rsquo;s website</em>: 29 October 2014</p> <p>Alnsiem was listed on 25 April 2006 by paragraph 1 of resolution 1672 (2006) as &ldquo;Paramount Chief of the Jalul Tribe in North Darfur&rdquo;.<strong></strong></p> <p><br> <em>Additional information</em></p> <p>Report from Human Rights Watch states they have a memo dated 13 February 2004 from a local government office in North Darfur ordering &ldquo;security units in the locality&rdquo; to &ldquo;allow the activities of the mujahideen and the volunteers under the command of the Sheikh Musa Hilal to proceed in the areas of [North Darfur] and to secure their vital needs&rdquo;. On 28 September 2005, 400 Arab militia attacked the villages of Aro Sharrow (including its IDP camp), Acho, and Gozmena in West Darfur. We also believe that Musa Hilal was present during the attack on Aro Sharrow IDP camp: his son had been killed during the SLA attack on Shareia, so he was now involved in a personal blood feud. There are reasonable grounds to believe that as the Paramount Chief he had direct responsibility for these actions and is responsible for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and other atrocities.</p> <h2> </h2>      <p>  </p>
