<!-- http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1591/SDi004.shtml --><p>In accordance with Section 5 (g) of its Guidelines, the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan makes accessible a narrative summary of reasons for the listing for individuals and entities included in the sanctions list.</p> <p><strong>SDi.004 Jibril Abdulkarim Ibrahim Mayu</strong><strong></strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee&rsquo;s website</em>: 29 October 2014</p> <p>Mayu was listed on 25 April 2006 by paragraph 1 of resolution 1672 (2006) as &ldquo;National Movement for Reform and Development Field Commander&rdquo;.<strong></strong></p> <p><br> <em>Additional information</em></p> <p>Mayu is responsible for the kidnapping of African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) personnel in Darfur during October 2005. Mayu openly attempts to thwart the AMIS mission through intimidation; for example he threatened to shoot down African Union (AU) helicopters in the Jebel Moon area in November 2005. Through such actions Mayu has clearly violated SCR 1591 in constituting a threat to stability in Darfur and meets the criteria to be designated by the Committee to be subjected to sanctions.<strong></strong></p> <h2> </h2>      <p>  </p>
