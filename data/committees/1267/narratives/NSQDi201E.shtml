The life insurance benefits were to be paid out to the brother of Yasser Abu Shaweesh, Ismail Mohamed Ismail Abu Shaweesh (QDi.224), as the designated beneficiary.</p> <p>From at least the summer of 2004, Yasser Abu Shaweesh agreed to attempt to acquire fraudulently large sums of money from life insurance companies, intending to direct a great part of this money to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) to fund its terrorist activities. In pursuit of this plan, Yasser Abu Shaweesh took out 9 life insurance policies totaling 1,264,092 Euros in benefits with a number of insurance companies. In cooperation with Khalil, Yasser Abu Shaweesh tried to take out 19 further insurance policies, which would have raised the total insured to 4,325,958 Euros. Yasser Abu Shaweesh was to fake a fatal traffic accident during his stay in Egypt. By obtaining a death certificate, if necessary through bribery, the life insurance benefits were to be paid out to Ismail Abu Shaweesh. Finally, the money was to be transferred abroad, and the individuals involved were to abscond. The major part of the money was to go to Al-Qaida. Khalil was primarily responsible for paying the insurance premiums.</p> <p>Yasser Abu Shaweesh had contacts, particularly via Khalil, to the international network of Al-Qaida. Before the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 as well as from 11 October 2001 until 12 September 2002, Khalil spent time in Al-Qaida training camps in Afghanistan. There, he was in contact with the leading cadres of Al-Qaida - also after the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 - who gave him instructions, and he himself took command of a group which belonged to Al-Qaida during the war in Afghanistan. Yasser Abu Shaweesh knew that Khalil supported Al-Qaida and assisted him in doing so. </p> <p>Yasser Abu Shaweesh was convicted in Germany in 2007 of supporting a foreign terrorist organization and on multiple counts of fraud and attempted fraud, and was sentenced to five years and six months of imprisonment. The judgement has taken final and binding effect. </p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Ibrahim Mohamad Khalil (QDi.206), listed on 6 December 2005<br> Ismail Mohamed Ismail Abu Shaweesh (QDi.224), listed on 2 August 2006</p>
