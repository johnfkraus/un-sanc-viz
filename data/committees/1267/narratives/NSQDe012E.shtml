<p><em>Additional information:</em></p>
<p><a name="OLE_LINK1">Makhtab al-Khidamat</a>, also known as the Afghan Service Bureau, is the pre-cursor organization to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and provided the basis for its infrastructure. It was created in the 1980s by Abdullah Azzam and Usama bin Laden
    (deceased) to establish guest houses near the Afghan border and paramilitary camps to prepare militants for the Afghan conflict.</p>
<p>Makhtab al-Khidamat helped channel fighters and money to Afghanistan, and established offices worldwide under the alias Al Kifah.</p>
<p>Disagreements between Azzam and Bin Laden in the late 1980s resulted in the creation of Al-Qaida by Bin Laden. After Azzam was killed in 1989, Bin Laden continued to utilize Makhtab al-Khidamat and the Al Kifah branches before absorbing them into Al-Qaida.</p>
