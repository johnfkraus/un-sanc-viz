<p><em>Additional information:</em>
    <br> </p>
<p>Maysar Ali Musa Abdallah al-Juburi was the sharia amir of Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137) as of early 2014. Earlier in 2013, Al-Juburi travelled to an Al-Nusrah Front training camp in northern Syria to provide religious lectures
    for fighters being trained at the camp. Al-Juburi was a member of Al-Nusrah Front&rsquo;s shura council as of mid-2013. As of late December 2013, Al-Juburi continued to serve as a senior official in Al-Nusrah Front.
    <br> </p>
<p>Al-Juburi moved from Mosul, Iraq, to Syria in late 2011 to exploit Syria's more permissive security environment with the objectives of transferring Al-Qaida&rsquo;s (QDe.004) ideology to Syria and forming likeminded terrorist groups. As of mid-2012, Al-Juburi
    became the main religious and military commander for Al-Nusrah Front in eastern Syria and also operated a training camp for the network.
