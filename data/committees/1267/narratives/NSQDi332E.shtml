<p>AAB was formed in 2009 and is connected to Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137). AAB is divided into two branches, the Lebanon-based Ziyad al-Jarrah Battalions and the Arabian Peninsula-based Yusuf al-'Uyayri Battalions. During 2014,
    AAB carried out joint attacks with Al-Nusrah Front. For example, in summer 2014, the two groups carried out a joint attack in the Qalumun area, Syria.

<p>AAB also claimed joint responsibility with Al-Nusrah Front in Lebanon for several rocket attacks in Hermel, Lebanon, in December 2013, January 2014, and March 2014. In December 2014, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani (QDi.317), the leader of Al-Nusrah Front, publicly
    stated that his group now had a Lebanese wing that had claimed responsibility for the Hermel rocket attack.

<p>AAB has also claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in Lebanon linked to the uprising in Syria, including the November 2013 attack on the Iranian Embassy in Beirut, which killed 147 people, and the February 2014 suicide bomb attack against the Iranian
    Cultural Center in Beirut that killed 129. After the Iranian Cultural Center bombing, AAB released a statement saying that the attacks were a sign of solidarity with the Syrian uprising.
