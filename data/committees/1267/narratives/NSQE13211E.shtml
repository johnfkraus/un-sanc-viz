Formed under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud, who has since died, TTP is rooted along the Afghanistan/Pakistan border. Hakimullah Mehsud (QDi.286) became the group's leader on Baitullah Mehsud's death in August 2009, and Wali Ur Rehman (QDi.287) is TTP's emir for the South Waziristan Agency. Some estimates suggest that TTP has between 30,000 and 35,000 members. </p> <p>TTP's stated objective is the overthrow of the elected government of Pakistan in order to establish an emirate based on its interpretation of Islamic law. To that end, TTP has worked to destabilize Pakistan by directly attacking the Pakistani army and assassinating politicians. </p> <p>TTP attacks, which have included multiple suicide bombings, have killed hundreds of members of the Pakistan defense forces, law enforcement personnel and civilians. Baitullah Mehsud, TTP's leader at the time, publicly claimed credit for the 30 March 2009 attack on a police academy in Lahore, Pakistan, in which the attackers fired automatic machine guns into an unarmed crowd of police recruits, killing eight people and wounding 100 others. Following Pakistan's military operations against Al-Qaida-affiliated groups (in particular the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010) and the Islamic Jihad Group (QDe.119)) in South Waziristan in September 2009, TTP claimed a number of high profile suicide attacks which aimed to "punish" the government and bring about a change of policy. TTP also claimed responsibility for the suicide attack on the World Food Programme headquarters in Islamabad in October 2009, and for an attack in July 2010 which killed over 50 people waiting to receive relief supplies outside the office of a senior government official in Mohmand Tribal Agency, Pakistan. Other attacks include the double suicide bombing of an administrative building in Mohmand Agency in December 2010, which killed over 40 people, and an attack on a Pakistan army compound in Mardan in February 2011, which killed 31. In May 2011, TTP operatives stormed the Mehran naval base in Karachi and killed at least 10 Pakistani security officers. </p> <p>TTP also claimed responsibility for an attempted bombing in Times Square, New York, USA, on 1 May 2010, and in April 2010 it launched a multi-pronged assault against the United States Consulate in Peshawar, killing at least six Pakistanis and wounding 20 others.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Islamic Jihad Group (QDe.119), listed on 1 June 2005 Hakimullah Mehsud (QDi.286), listed on 21 October 2010<br> Aamir Ali Chaudhry (QDi.312), listed on 18 October 2012</p>
