The attacks resulted in the deaths of 224 people and injured about 5,000, as well as severely damaging or destroying the embassies and several other buildings.  </p> <p>In the spring of 1997, Wadih el-Hage, an Al-Qaida operative and convicted co-conspirator, provided Fadhil with orders from Usama bin Laden (deceased) to militarize Al-Qaida's East African cell. In 1998, while plotting the bombing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Fadhil resided with Khalfan Khamis Mohammed and met with Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani (QDi.028), Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan (deceased) and Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam (deceased) at Ghailani's residence in Dar es Salaam. At Fadhil's request, Ghailani obtained a cellular telephone to facilitate communications for the group responsible for the Dar es Salaam bombing. Fadhil, Khalfan Khamis Mohammed and the suicide bomber who drove the vehicle carrying the explosives, helped to prepare the bomb in July 1998. Muhsin Moussa Matwalli Atwah Dewedar (deceased), the bomb engineer, supervised and assisted the bomb assembly.
