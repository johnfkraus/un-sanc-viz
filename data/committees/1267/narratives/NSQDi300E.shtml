At some unspecified date, probably in April 2007, they left Germany for Yemen, and thereafter joined the IMU, integrating themselves permanently into its structures.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2008 Monir and Yassin Chouka and others recorded the video &quot;Good News from Afghanistan&quot;. In January 2009 they took part in the video &quot;Allah's Soldier Part 1&quot;. In April 2009 the video &quot;Victory or Shahada&quot; followed. In September 2009 appeared the fourth video, &quot;Merits of Jihad&quot;.

Monir and Yassin Chouka put themselves in the service of the organization as multipliers, disseminating the organization's messages over the Internet and thereby inter alia recruiting new members or supporters.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p> Yassin Chouka (QDi.301), listed on 25 January 2012</p>
