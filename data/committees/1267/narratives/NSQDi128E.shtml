<p><em>Additional information:</em></p>
<p>Ismail Abdallah Sbaitan Shalabi acted jointly with other persons in Germany from at least the summer of 2001 to 23 April 2002 as a member of a German cell of Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), also known as &quot;Al-Tawhid&quot; movement. This organization had
    close personal and organizational links to the Al-Qaida (QDe.004) network. Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased), a.k.a. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was the operational leader of Al-Tawhid. </p>
<p>By September 2001, an independent "Al-Tawhid" cell was formed in Germany around Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess (QDi.130). The cell worked in an insular and clandestine manner, mostly operating independently within the scope of directives from operational
    and religious leaders abroad. It was an integral part of an international network which, among other things, ensured that the organization received logistic and financial support.</p>
<p>Shalabi was an important contact for Abu Dhess in North and West Germany. He held a leadership position within the cell and was aware of and approved its violent objectives both in Germany and abroad. Shalabi was also involved in transfers of funds by
    the group.</p>
<p>Apart from Shalabi and Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess, other members of the cell in Germany included Aschraf al-Dagma (QDi.132). </p>
<p>The cell's activities in Germany consisted mainly of forging passports, collecting donations and facilitating the illegal cross-border travel of persons linked to the "Al-Tawhid" organization. However, in early September 2001, Al-Zarqawi met Mohamed Ghassan
    Ali Abu Dhess in Iran and instructed him to commit terrorist attacks in Germany. The plan was to use a pistol fitted with a silencer and a crate of hand grenades to carry out an attack on a busy square in a German town or city and to let off hand
    grenades in another German town in the immediate vicinity of an Israeli or Jewish property with the aim of killing as many people as possible. The attacks were supposed to be carried out by Ismail Shalabi together with other member of the cell, including
    Al-Dagma. However, before the weapons could be delivered, Ismail Shalabi was arrested on 23 April 2002, together with other members of the cell, including Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess, Aschraf al-Dagma, and Djamel Moustfa (QDi.129). </p>
<p>On 26 October 2005, Ismail Shalabi, together with Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess and Aschraf al-Dagma, was convicted in Germany of plotting attacks and belonging to a terrorist organization. Ismail Shalabi was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment.
