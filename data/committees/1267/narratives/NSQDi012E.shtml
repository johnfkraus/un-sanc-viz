<p>Nashwan Abd al-Razzaq Abd al-Baqi was one of Al-Qaida's (QDe.004) highest ranking and experienced members at the time of his capture in April 2007. He had been one of the organization's key paramilitary commanders in Afghanistan from the late 1990s and,
    between 2002 and 2004, was in charge of cross-border attacks in Afghanistan against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). He also directed plots to assassinate opponents of Al-Qaida, including Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and
    a United Nations official. Al-Baqi tried to return to his native country, Iraq, to manage Al-Qaida's affairs and possibly focus on operations outside Iraq against Western targets. Al-Baqi also met Al-Qaida members in Iran and believed that they should
    be doing more, including supporting Al-Qaida efforts in Iraq and causing problems within Iran. Al-Baqi provided leadership and reconnaissance support during a rocket attack in the fall of 2003 against United States military forces in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Al-Baqi was a former member of the Iraqi military who spent more than 15 years in Afghanistan. Before 11 September 2001, he was a member of Al-Qaida's ruling shura council as well as the group's military committee, which oversaw terrorist and guerrilla
    operations and paramilitary training. Al-Baqi had been a member of Al-Qaida since late 1990s, working as an instructor in one of Al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan. Al-Baqi was known and trusted by Usama bin Laden (deceased) and Aiman Muhammed
    Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006) and was in direct communication with both leaders, at one point serving as Al-Zawahiri's caretaker. Al-Baqi also interacted with other senior Al-Qaida planners and decision makers, such as Khalid Shaykh Muhammad and Abu
    Faraj al-Libi, listed as Ali Mohamed Abdul Aziz al Zar'ani al Fakhiri (deceased), and Hamza Rabi'a and Muhsin Moussa Matwalli Atwah Dewedar (deceased), prior to their deaths. Al-Baqi associated with leaders of other extremist groups allied with Al-Qaida
    in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including the Taliban. Al-Baqi worked directly with the Taliban to determine responsibilities and lines of communication between Taliban and Al-Qaida leaders in Afghanistan, specifically with regard to attacks on multinational
    forces.
