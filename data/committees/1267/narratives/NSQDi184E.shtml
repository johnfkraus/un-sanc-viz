<p>Muhsin Fadhil Ayed Ashour al-Fadhli has acted for or on behalf of Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, listed as Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased). Al-Fadhli is an Al-Qaida leader in the Persian Gulf. He was the bodyguard and second-in-command
    for a leader in the Al-Qaida network and fought with Al-Qaida in the north of Afghanistan. Al-Fadhli also fought against Russian forces in Chechnya, where he trained in the use of firearms, antiaircraft guns and explosives. Al-Fadhli was a facilitator
    connected with the Al-Zarqawi groups in Iraq, providing support to fighters there. In an effort to solidify the support of key financial backers sponsoring attacks, Al-Fadhli asked for tapes showing evidence of successful attacks in Iraq. Al-Fadhli
    was implicated in an attack against United States Marines on the Kuwaiti Faylaka Island on 8 October 2002, in which one Marine died. </p>
<p>Al-Fadhli also raised money in Kuwait which was used to finance the 6 October 2002 attack on the French ship, MV LIMBURG, off the coast of Yemen and was earmarked to fund another operation against United States interests. Al-Qaida operative Muhammad al-Hamati,
    listed as Mohammad Hamdi Mohammad Sadiq al-Ahdal (QDi.020), called Al-Fadhli in the wake of the attack on the MV LIMBURG to inform him that the operation had been completed. </p>
<p>In February 2003, a Kuwaiti Court convicted four suspects, including Al-Fadhli, of providing funding for terrorist activities and undergoing military training in Afghanistan for the purposes of terrorism. The Kuwaiti Court handed down five-year jail sentences
    to the suspects. Al-Fadhli has also been charged by the authorities of Saudi Arabia for terrorist activities committed inside the Kingdom.</p>
