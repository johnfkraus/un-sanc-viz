When viewed as a single entity, Al-Haramain was one of the principal NGOs active throughout the world providing support for the Al-Qaida (QDe.004) network. Funding generally came from individual benefactors and special campaigns which targeted selected business entities around the world. </p> <p>The founder and former leader of Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, Aqeel Abdulaziz Aqeel al-Aqeel (QDi.171.04<strong>)</strong>, and the Al-Haramain branches in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia (QDe.072), Indonesia (QDe.103), Kenya (QDe.105), Tanzania (QDe.106), Pakistan (QDe.104), Afghanistan (QDe.110), Albania (QDe.111), Bangladesh (QDe.112), Ethiopia (QDe.113), the Netherlands (QDe.114), the Union of the Comoros (QDe.116) and the United States of America (QDe.117) have provided financial, material and/or technological support to the Al-Qaida network, including Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003) and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118). These terrorist organizations received funding from Al-Haramain and used Al-Haramain as a front for fundraising and operational activities.</p> <p>The Bosnia and Herzegovina office of Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation was linked to Al-Gama'at al-Islamiyya, an Egyptian terrorist group that was a signatory to Usama bin Laden's 23 February 1998 statement establishing the "World Islamic <em>Front</em> for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders". After the Bosnia and Herzegovina branch of Al-Haramain was designated in March 2002, its operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina were closed. The organization was reestablished in mid-2003 under a different name, Vazir, in Travnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in a business space formerly used by Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation and opened its offices in early August 2003. Vazir has since been closed.</p>  <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003), listed on 6 October 2001 <br> Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation (Somalia) (QDe.072), listed on 13 March 2002<br> Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Indonesia) (QDe.103.04<strong>), </strong>listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Pakistan), (QDe.104), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramayn Foundation (Kenya) (QDe.105), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramayn Foundation (Tanzania) (QDe.106), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramain: Afghanistan Branch (QDe.110), listed on 6 July 2004 <br> Al-Haramain: Albania Branch (QDe.111), listed on 6 July 2004 <br> Al-Haramain: Bangladesh Branch (QDe.112), listed on 6 July 2004<br> Al-Haramain: Ethiopia Branch (QDe.113), listed on 6 July 2004<br> Al-Haramain: The Netherlands Branch (QDe.114), listed on 6 July 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Union of the Comoros) (QDe.116), listed on 28 September 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (United States of America) (QDe.117), listed on 28 September 2004<br> Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118), listed on 2 May 2005</p> <p> Najib ben Mohamed ben Salem al-Waz (QDi.104), listed on 25 June 2003<br> Aqeel Abdulaziz Aqeel al-Aqeel (QDi.171), listed on 6 July 2004 </p>
