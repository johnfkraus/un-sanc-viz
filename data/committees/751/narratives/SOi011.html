    <br> <em>Additional information</em></p>
<p>"Kenya based extremist Aboud Rogo Mohammed has threatened the peace, security, or stability of Somalia, by providing financial, material, logistical, or technical support to al-Shabaab, an entity listed by the UNSC Committee established pursuant to resolution
    751 (1992) concerning Somalia and resolution 1907 (2009) concerning Eritrea for engaging in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, security, or stability of Somalia. Aboud Rogo Mohammed is an extremist Islamic cleric based in Kenya.
    He continues to exert influence over extremist groups in East Africa as part of his campaign to promote violence throughout East Africa. Aboud Rogo's activities include fund-raising for al-Shabaab. As the main ideological leader of Al Hijra, formerly
    known as the Muslim Youth Center, Aboud Rogo Mohammed has used the extremist group as a pathway for radicalization and recruitment of principally Swahili speaking Africans for carrying out violent militant activity in Somalia. In a series of inspirational
    lectures between February 2009 and February 2012, Aboud repeatedly called for the violent rejection of the Somali peace process. During these lectures, Rogo repeatedly called for the use of violence against both the United Nations and the African
    Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces in Somalia, and urged his audiences to travel to Somalia to join al-Shabaab's fight against the Kenyan Government. Aboud Rogo Mohammed also offers guidance on how Kenyan recruits joining al-Shabaab can evade
    detection by the Kenyan authorities, and which routes to follow when traveling from Mombasa and/or Lamu to Al-Shabaab strongholds in Somalia, notably Kismayo. He has facilitated the travel to Somalia of numerous Kenyan recruits for al-Shabaab. In
    September 2011, Rogo was recruiting individuals in Mombasa, Kenya for travel into Somalia, presumably to conduct terrorist operations. In September 2008, Rogo held a fundraising meeting in Mombasa to help finance al-Shabaab activities in Somalia."
