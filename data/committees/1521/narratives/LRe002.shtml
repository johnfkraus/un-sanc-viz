Originally active in Belgium, it has had to move more than once since it first appeared in 1995 due to investigations by authorities in Belgium, Swaziland and South Africa. Air Cess is the only firm in Bout's network that ever officially listed him as its head. In Swaziland, Bout entered into a joint venture with a South African company to form Air Pass. Air Cess had 90% ownership of this joint venture. Records show that Bout owned 90% of the shares of Air Pass. According to NGO reporting, Viktor transferred daily operational control of Air Cess to his brother, Sergei Bout, some time during the 1990s. This entity can thus be considered to be owned or controlled by either Viktor and/or Sergei Bout. </p> <h2> </h2>      <p>  </p>
