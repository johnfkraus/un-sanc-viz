<!-- http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1521/LRe025.shtml --><p>In accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2079 (2012), the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia makes accessible a narrative summary of reasons for the listing for individuals and entities included in the sanctions list.</p> <p><strong>LRe.025 SANTA CRUZ IMPERIAL AIRLINES</strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee&rsquo;s website</em>: 29 October 2014</p> <p>Santa Cruz Imperial Airlines was listed on 30 November 2005 pursuant to paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004).</p> <p><br> <em>Additional information</em></p> <p>Santa Cruz Imperial has been identified by various sources as being owned or controlled by Viktor Bout and/or Sanjivan Ruprah (also already listed by the Liberian Sanctions Committee). However, there has been some disagreement as to whether Viktor Bout actually owned this company. Nevertheless, Santa Cruz aircraft have operated interchangeably with aircraft from Bout's network. For example, Viktor Bout has used Santa Cruz aircraft to sell arms to UNITA in Angola and to sell aircraft to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Accordingly, Bout has at least indirect control over Santa Cruz.</p> <h2> </h2>      <p>  </p>
