Jaish-i-Mohammed sought to use Al-Akhtar Trust as a way to deliver arms and ammunition to its members under the guise of providing humanitarian aid to refugees and other needy groups. Al-Akhtar Trust International was established for the purpose of providing financial assistance for fighters, financial support to the Taliban, and food, clothes, and education to orphans of "martyrs". At a ceremony in Islamabad celebrating the establishment of the trust, one of the senior leaders of Harakat ul-Mujahidin (QDe.008), termed the establishment of Al-Akhtar Trust as "commendable". There was an appeal to the people to support it generously.</p> <p>The chairman and chief executive of Al-Akhtar Trust stated that his organization's services for the Taliban and Mullah Omar, listed as Mohammed Omar Ghulam Nabi (TAi.004 on the 1988 Sanctions List) were known to the world. </p> <p>As of mid-November 2001, the Al-Akhtar Trust was secretly treating wounded members of Al-Qaida (QDe.004) at the medical centers it was operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p> <p>In 2003, a senior Al-Qaida detainee related that Al-Akhtar Trust together with Al Rashid Trust (QDe.005) were the primary relief agencies that Al-Qaida used to move supplies into Kandahar, Afghanistan.
