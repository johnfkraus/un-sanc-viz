He fled Malaysia for the Philippines in August 2003 where he conducted bomb-making training courses for the Abu Sayyaf Group (QDe.001).</p> <p>Following the arrest of another Malaysian national who was in charge of JI's training in the southern Philippines, Abdul Hir became one of the top JI trainers. </p> <p>Abdul Hir was implicated in a string of bombings across central Mindanao, the Philippines, in 2006. Working with a possible renegade member of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) (not listed), Abdul Hir launched attacks to destabilize the peace process between the MILF and the government of the Philippines and as revenge for government offensives against the Abu Sayyaf Group, which had given sanctuary to two JI leaders, Joko Pitono (deceased), also known as Dulmatin, and Umar Patek (QDi.294).</p> <p>Between 2003 and July 2007, Abdul Hir was in contact with his brother, who was living abroad, to seek his participation in and support for terrorist acts in the Philippines. Abdul Hir instructed his brother to send him money so that he could purchase firearms, radios and ammunition. Some of these items were intended for use by MILF against the Philippines government. Wire transfers were made to bank accounts in fictitious names at false addresses so as to make tracking more difficult. Abdul Hir also asked for radios with a two-mile range of the kind that has been used to detonate improvised explosive devices. He also sought to acquire firearms. </p> <p>Abdul Hir is wanted by the authorities of the United States for conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and for providing material support to terrorists. On 1 August 2007, he was indicted by a court in the United States for these offences. </p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Abu Sayyaf Group (QDe.001), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin (QDi.087), listed on 28 January 2003<br> Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani (QDi.180), listed on 22 December 2004<br> Abu Rusdan (QDi.186), listed on 16 May 2005<br> Zulkarnaen (QDi.187), listed on 16 May 2005<br> Abu Bakar Ba'asyir (QDi.217), listed on 21 April 2006<br> Umar Patek (QDi.294), listed on 19 July 2011</p>
