He actively recruited members of the organization and succeeded in raising funds for various RSM projects, including from the International Islamic Relief Organization, Philippines, Branch Offices (QDe.126). He also acquired skills in the manufacture of bombs and improvised explosive devices. After founding the RSM in January 2002, he permitted and even directed its members to be deployed by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) (QDe.001) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) (QDe.092) as bombers or in support roles. Santos has been involved in the planning of bombing attacks against Philippines and non-Philippines civilians and in the stockpiling of weapons to conduct such operations. </p> <p>In May 2002, he was directed by JI operative Fathur Rohman al-Ghozhi (deceased) to launch terrorist attacks in Metro Manila to support the terrorist activities of JI and the ASG. The RSM members tasked by Santos to launch the attacks were arrested by Philippines security forces before they were able to execute their plans. </p> <p>Santos recruited Angelo Ramirez Trinidad (QDi.241) to the RSM in 2002 and subsequently instructed him to undergo a demolition and explosives training course in 2004 conducted by JI in camp Jabal Quba. Santos himself attended training courses on explosives which were facilitated by JI in Liguasan Marsh, Maguindanao. One of his instructors was Joko Pitono a.k.a. Dulmatin (deceased).</p> <p>Santos was responsible for planning operation "Big Bang", which was foiled by Philippines authorities in 2005. The concept of the operation was to target the Embassy of the United States of America and business establishments in Ermita, Manila, which were frequented by foreigners, particularly Americans, with a vehicle rigged with explosives. The attack was planned by the RSM, on behalf of JI and the ASG, at a meeting presided over by Santos in August 2004 in Baranguay Dita, Sta Rosa, Laguna. Santos selected the RSM members that were to execute the plan. Upon instructions from Santos, an RSM operative, Ricardo Perez Ayeras (QDi.248), rented a car and used it to transport explosives acquired from illegal explosives manufacturers in Bulacan to a safe house in Pasig City, and then to Fairview, Quezon City. In March 2005, the Philippines authorities recovered 650 kilograms of explosives and components for improvised explosive devices from an apartment rented by the RSM in Lilac Street, Fairview, Quezon City. RSM member Pio Abogne De Vera (QDi.245) admitted that the material was for operation "Big Bang". </p>  <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Abu Sayyaf Group (QDe.001), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002<br> International Islamic Relief Organization, Philippines, Branch offices (QDe.126), listed on 4 August 2006<br> Rajah Solaiman Movement (QDe.128), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p> Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani (QDi.180), listed on 22 December 2004<br> Jainal Antel Sali Jr. (QDi.209), listed on 6 December 2005<br> Angelo Ramirez Trinidad (QDi.241), listed on 4 June 2008<br> Dinno Amor Rosalejos Pareja (QDi.242), listed on 4 June 2008<br> Feliciano Semborio Delos Reyes Jr. (QDi.243), listed on 4 June 2008<br> Pio Abogne De Vera (QDi.245), listed on 4 June 2008<br> Redendo Cain Dellosa (QDi.246), listed on 4 June 2008<br> Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. (QDi.247), listed on 4 June 2008<br> Ricardo Perez Ayeras (QDi.248), listed on 4 June 2008</p>
