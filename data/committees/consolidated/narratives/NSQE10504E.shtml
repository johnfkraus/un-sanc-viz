When viewed as a single entity, Al-Haramain was one of the principal NGOs active throughout the world providing support for the Al-Qaida network. Funding generally came from individual benefactors and special campaigns which targeted selected business entities around the world.<a href='http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQE10504E.shtml' target='_blank'><u> </u></a></p> <p>The founder and former leader of Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, Aqeel Abdulaziz Aqeel al-Aqeel (QDi.171.04<strong>)</strong>, and the Al-Haramain branches in Bosnia and Herzegovina (QDe.071), Somalia (QDe.072), Indonesia (QDe.103), Kenya, Tanzania (QDe.106), Pakistan (QDe.104), Afghanistan (QDe.110), Albania (QDe.111), Bangladesh (QDe.112), Ethiopia (QDe.113), the Netherlands (QDe.114), the Union of the Comoros (QDe.116) and the United States of America (QDe.117) have provided financial, material and/or technological support to the Al-Qaida network, including Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003) and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118). These terrorist organizations received funding from Al-Haramain and used Al-Haramain as a front for fundraising and operational activities.</p> <p>AHF offices in Kenya and Tanzania provided support, or acted for or on behalf of AIAI and Al-Qaida. AIAI has shared ideological, financial and training links with Al-Qaida and financial links with several NGOs and companies including AHF, which it used to transfer funds. AHF, together with three other NGOs, served as fronts of AIAI in Kenya.</p> <p>As early as 1997, the Kenyan branch of AHF was involved in plotting terrorist attacks against Americans. As a result, a number of individuals connected to AHF in Kenya were arrested and later deported by Kenyan authorities.</p> <p>In August 1997, an AHF employee indicated that the planned attack against the United States Embassy in Nairobi would be a suicide bombing carried out by crashing a vehicle into the gate of the Embassy. A wealthy AHF official outside East Africa had agreed to provide the necessary funds. </p> <p>Also in 1997, AHF senior activists in Nairobi decided to alter their (then) previous plans to bomb the United States Embassy in Nairobi and instead sought to attempt to assassinate United States citizens. During this period, an AHF official indicated that he had obtained five hand grenades and seven "bazookas" from a source in Somalia. These weapons were to be used in a possible assassination attempt against a United States official.</p> <p>Wadih el-Hage, a leader of the Al-Qaida cell in East Africa and personal secretary to Usama bin Laden, visited the Kenya offices of AHF before the 1998 attacks on the United States Embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam. El-Hage possessed contact information for a senior AHF official who was head of AHF's Africa Committee, the overseeing authority for AHF's offices in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>AHF (Kenya) was deregistered in 1998, following its alleged links with Al-Qaida and the United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed over 200 people. However, in 1999, AHF (Kenya) successfully contested deregistration in the courts and resumed operations the following year, in 2000.</p> <p>In 2004, AHF (Kenya) started disposing of its assets with a view to winding up its operations. In 2005, AHF sold its premises to another organization. Although AHF has reportedly scaled down its activities and closed its offices, some personalities associated with it may be operating other similar organizations in the country.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003), listed on 6 October 2001 <br> Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Makhtab al-Khidamat (QDe.012), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation (QDe.071), listed on 13 March 2002<br> Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation (Somalia) (QDe.072), listed on 13 March 2002 <br> Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Indonesia), (QDe.103), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Pakistan) (QDe.104), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramayn Foundation (Tanzania) (QDe.106), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramain: Afghanistan Branch (QDe.110), listed on 6 July 2004 <br> Al-Haramain: Albania Branch (QDe.111), listed on 6 July 2004 <br> Al-Haramain: Bangladesh Branch (QDe.112), listed on 6 July 2004<br> Al-Haramain: Ethiopia Branch (QDe.113), listed on 6 July 2004<br> Al-Haramain: The Netherlands Branch (QDe.114), listed on 6 July 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Union of the Comoros) (QDe.116), listed on 28 September 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (United States of America) (QDe.117), listed on 28 September 2004<br> Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118), listed on 2 May 2005</p> <p> Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani (QDi.028), listed on 17 October 2001<br> Aqeel Abdulaziz Aqeel al-Aqeel (QDi.171), listed on 6 July 2004 </p>
