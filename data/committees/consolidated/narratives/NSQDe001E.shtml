It was formed from the more militant elements of the Moro National Liberation Front, an established separatist movement in the southern Philippines. ASG is based in the southern Philippines, primarily the Sulu archipelago, Tawi Tawi, Basilan and Mindanao. Members also occasionally travel to Manila. ASG often resorts to criminal activity, including murders, bombings, extortion and kidnap for ransom both for financial profit and to promote its agenda.</p> <p>Abdurajak Janjalani was killed in a clash with Philippine police in December 1998. His younger brother, Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani (QDi.180), replaced him as the leader of the group. In September 2006, Janjalani was killed in a gun battle with the Armed Forces of the Philippines; Radulan Sahiron (QDi.208) became the new ASG leader. </p> <p>ASG has links to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) (QDe.092), and ASG members have been trained by both organizations in guerrilla warfare, military operations and bomb making. Usama bin Laden's (deceased) brother-in-law, Mohammad Jammal Khalifa, used an organization to channel funds to ASG to pay for training and arms.</p> <p>ASG has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, including assassinations; bombing civilian and military establishments and domestic infrastructure, including airports and ferries;<a href='http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQDe001E.shtml' target='_blank'><u> </u></a>kidnapping local officials and foreign tourists; beheading local and foreign hostages; and extortion against local and foreign businesses.
