DJAMAT HOUMAT DAAWA SALAFIA (DHDS)</u></a></strong><strong><a href='http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQE10203E.shtml' target='_blank'><u> </u></a></strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee's website</em>: 27 January 2010</p> <p>Djamat Houmat Daawa Salafia was listed on <strong>11 November 2003 </strong>pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 1390 (2002) as being associated with Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden or the Taliban for "participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf, or in support of" the Armed Islamic Group (QE.A.6.01). </p> <p><em>Additional information:</em></p> <p>Djamat Houmat Daawa Salafia (DHDS), formerly known as Katibat el Ahouel, was founded in 1996 by Kada Benchikha Larbi, a veteran from Afghanistan and a former Armed Islamic Group (QE.A.6.01), a.k.a. GIA, commander. Some DHDS members were former volunteers in non-governmental organizations including Al-Haramain, of which several branches are listed. Well organized and equipped with military materiel, DHDS has links to Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01) and has engaged in terrorist activity in Algeria and internationally. DHDS was responsible for numerous killings from the mid-1990s onwards.</p> <p>Kada Benchikha Larbi founded DHDS as a result of his opposition to Djamel Zitouni, then emir of GIA. Already the top GIA commander in western Algeria, Benchikha used his position to establish his own faction as a semi-autonomous organization, but continued to work closely with GIA following the accession of Antar Zouabri to the group's leadership.</p> <p>After the death of Benchikha at the hands of Algerian security forces in 1999, another veteran of the Afghan conflict, Mohammed Benslim, a.k.a. Slim al-Abbasi Abou Djaafar al-Afghani, assumed the leadership of DHDS. Benslim broke away from the GIA completely after Zouabri's death.</p> <p>From 1999 onwards, DHDS worked to create its own sources of funding abroad, targeting in particular Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and France, by taking over part of the support networks affiliated with GIA and GSPC, listed as the Organization of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QE.T.14.01), as well as by developing ties with Al-Qaida-affiliated ideologues such as Abu Qatada al-Filistini, listed as Uthman Omar Mahmoud (QI.M.31.01), and Abu Hamza al-Masri, listed as Mostafa Kamel Mostafa Ibrahim (QI.I.67.02).</p> <p>Towards the end of 2001, DHDS tried to establish cells in the western part of Algeria with a view to committing terrorist acts, murdering local leaders, collecting funds and sabotaging economic infrastructure. DHDS has been responsible for the deaths of several dozen Algerian citizens and the destruction of economic, social and cultural infrastructure in Algeria. It has terrorized people living both in cities and remote regions, forcing them to leave their homes and abandon their assets. Its members have tried to recruit young people by force in order to swell its ranks.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Armed Islamic Group (QE.A.6.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> The Organization of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QE.T.14.01), listed on 6 October 2001 </p> <p>Uthman Omar Mahmoud (QI.M.31.01), listed on 17 October 2001<br> Mostafa Kamel Mostafa Ibrahim (QI.I.67.02), listed on 24 April 2002</p>
