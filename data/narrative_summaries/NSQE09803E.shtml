Al-Qaida and Usama bin Laden (deceased) participated in the formation and funding of Ansar al-Islam, and Ansar al-Islam has provided safe haven to Al-Qaida in northeastern Iraq. Ansar al-Islam's predecessor, Jund al-Islam, was formed in September 2001. Ansar al-Islam came into being with the blessing of Bin Laden after its leaders visited Al-Qaida in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001. Bin Laden provided Ansar al-Islam with an estimated USD 300,000 to USD 600,000 in seed money. </p> <p>Ansar al-Islam has received training and logistical assistance from Al-Qaida. Members of Ansar al-Islam have traveled to Afghanistan to train with the organization, while Ansar al-Islam's non-Iraqi members are believed to be Al-Qaida trained veterans of conflicts in Afghanistan and Chechnya, the Russian Federation. </p> <p>Ansar al-Islam also cooperated closely with senior Al-Qaida operative Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased), also known as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose network established a poisons and explosives training center in northeastern Iraq controlled by Ansar al-Islam.

This organization has been located and primarily active in northern Iraq, but also maintained a presence in western and central Iraq. </p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p> Omar Mahmoud Uthman (QI.M.31.01), listed on 17 October 2001<br> Said ben Abdelhakim ben Omar al-Cherif (QI.A.138.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Imad ben Mekki Zarkaoui (QI.A.139.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Kamal ben Maoeldi ben Hassan al-Hamraoui (QI.A.140.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Maxamed Cabdullaah Ciise (QI.C.141.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Radi Abd el Samie Abou el Yazid el Ayashi (QI.E.142.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Hamadi ben Abdul Aziz ben Ali Bouyehia (QI.B.143.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Mohammad Tahir Hammid (QI.H.144.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Mohamed Amin Mostafa (QI.M.147.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Nessim ben Mohamed al-Cherif ben Mohamed Saleh al-Saadi (QI.S.148.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Noureddine ben Ali ben Belkassem al-Drissi (QI.A.149.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Al-Azhar ben Khalifa ben Ahmed Rouine (QI.R.150.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Mourad ben Ali ben al-Basheer al-Trabelsi (QI.A.151.03), listed on 12 November 2003<br> Abd-al-Majid Aziz al-Zindani (QI.A.156.04), listed on 27 February 2004<br> Faycal Boughanemi (QI.B.188.05), listed on 29 July 2005<br> Abdelkader Laagoub (QI.L.190.05), listed on 29 July 2005<br> Ata Abdoulaziz Rashid (QI.A.199.05), listed on 6 December 2005<br> Dieman Abdulkadir Izzat (QI.A.200.05), listed on 6 December 2005<br> Mazen Salah Mohammed (QI.A.202.05), listed on 6 December 2005 <br> Farhad Kanabi Ahmad (QI.A.203.05), listed on 6 December 2005 <br> Rafik Mohamad Yousef (QI.M.205.05), listed on 6 December 2005<br> Jamal Housni (QI.H.221.06), listed on 2 August 2006<br> Nessim ben Romdhane Sahraoui (QI.S.222.06), listed on 2 August 2006<br> Merai Zoghbai (QI.Z.223.06), listed on 2 August 2006<br> Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad (QI.A.226.06), listed on 7 December 2006 <br> Jaber Abdallah Jaber Ahmad al-Jalahmah (QI.A.237.08), listed on 16 January 2008<br> Mubarak Mushakhas Sanad Mubarak al-Bathali (QI.A. 238.08), listed on 16 January 2008</p>
