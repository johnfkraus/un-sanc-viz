Al-Jalahmah went to Afghanistan three times in the late 1990s/early 2000s to provide large sums of money to Usama bin Laden. In one of these meetings, in early to mid-2001, Usama bin Laden agreed to set up a training camp especially for Kuwaitis in Afghanistan. This plan was never put into action.</p> <p>In the late 1990s/early 2000s, Al-Jalahmah also visited the Al-Faruq training camp, supplying global positioning systems, laptop computers and a video camera. </p> <p>In mid-2001, Al-Jalahmah sent a Kuwaiti individual to Afghanistan where he attended the Al-Qaida-associated Al-Faruq training camp. Al-Jalahmah gave him money to transfer to Al-Qaida. Al-Jalahmah also sent recruits and supplies to Al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Soon after 11 September 2001, Al-Jalahmah sent supplies to Afghanistan for use by Al-Qaida trainees. </p> <p>In 2002, a senior Al-Qaida leader asked Al-Jalahmah to raise money for planned terrorist operations in the Middle East, for training, for passport acquisition, and for the families of operatives.</p> <p>Al-Jalahmah was involved in the planning of the 21 January 2003, Al-Qaida-linked terrorist attack on two civilian contractors in Kuwait and provided support and assistance to one of the perpetrators. </p> <p>As early as 2004, Al-Jalahmah coordinated recruitment efforts to send fighters, including suicide bombers, and funds into Iraq for Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04). Trusted associates were sometimes given thousands of dollars to transport from Kuwait to Iraq. Al-Jalahmah collected and funneled money to Al-Qaida associated individuals in Kuwait, providing thousands of Kuwaiti dinars to Al-Qaida associated operatives on a regular basis, including to Muhsin Fadhil Ayed Ashour al-Fadhli (QI.A.184.05). </p> <p>As of mid-2004, Al-Jalahmah collected money from lesser financiers in Kuwait and funneled it to Al-Qaida. As of that time, Jalahmah provided tens of thousands of dollars each week to Al-Qaida fighters. </p> <p>In mid-2010, Al-Jalahmah provided funds to an individual associated with Al-Qaida in Iraq. </p> <p>In 2012, Al-Jalahmah provided several thousand dollars for Al-Qaida members in Yemen as well as the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. </p> <p>In 2012, Al-Jalahmah, was praised by a senior Al-Qaida member for providing support, and was relied on by Al-Qaida for additional aid. </p> <p>In 2012, al-Jalahmah sought to finance an Al-Qaida suicide attack.</p> <p>As of early 2014, Al-Jalahmah financially supported the Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QE.A.137.14) in Syria. </p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04), listed on 18 October 2004<br> Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QE.A.137.14), listed on14 May 2014</p> <p> Muhsin Fadhil Ayed Ashour al-Fadhli (QI.A.184.05), listed on 17 February 2005</p>
