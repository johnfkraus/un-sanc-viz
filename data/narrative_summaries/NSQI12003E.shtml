He was arrested in Manila, the Philippines, in January 1995 in a raid that resulted in the seizure of a large quantity of chemicals and other paraphernalia used in the manufacture of explosives. He was turned over to the United States and indicted for conspiring to blow up simultaneously 12 United States commercial airliners while airborne, a project codenamed "Bojinka". The key planners of the plot were Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01) operations directors Khalid Shaikh Mohammad and Ramzi Yousef. Khalid Shaikh Mohammad was indicted as a co-conspirator of the "Bojinka" plot in 1996 but avoided standing trial by eluding law authorities.
