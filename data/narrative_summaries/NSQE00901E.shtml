It was founded in the early 1990s by Abu Al-Hassan and other Yemenis upon their return from fighting in Afghanistan. </p> <p>IAA received financial and material support from Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01) leader Usama bin Laden (deceased) in exchange for its support for Al-Qaida's agenda. For example, IAA publicly declared its support for the 1998 attacks by Al-Qaida against the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It later extended its support for Bin Laden after the United States' retaliatory strikes on Al-Qaida training camps in Afghanistan.</p> <p>IAA has claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on American and British interests in Yemen, and has threatened Western doctors and tourists in the country. On 28 December 1998, IAA gunmen kidnapped 16 western tourists in Yemen and demanded the release of several of its militants who had been arrested a week earlier. Yemeni security forces stormed the IAA hideout where the hostages were being held. Four hostages died in the raid. Al-Hassan was executed in 1999 for his role in the kidnapping. IAA also played a role in the 12 October 2000 bombing of the American warship USS Cole in Aden Harbor, Yemen, which killed 17 American sailors and injured 39 others. The attack was sponsored and conducted in coordination with Al-Qaida.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QE.A.2.01), listed on 6 October 2001 <br> <br> Hassan Dahir Aweys (QI.D.42.01), listed on 9 November 2001<br> Mostafa Kamel Mostafa Ibrahim (QI.I.67.02), listed on 24 April 2002 </p>
