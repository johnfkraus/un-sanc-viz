HAMID ABDALLAH AHMAD AL-ALI<br> </u></a></strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee's website</em>: 6 April 2009</p> <p>Hamid Abdallah Ahmad al-Ali was listed on <strong>16 January 2008</strong> pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 12 of resolution 1735 (2006) as being associated with Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01) for "participating in the financing, planning, facilitating or perpetrating acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, or in support of", "supplying, selling or transferring arms and related materiel to" and "recruiting for" Al-Qaida affiliated cells in Kuwait.</p> <p><em>Additional information:</em></p> <p>Hamid Abdallah Ahmad al-Ali is a Kuwait-based terrorist facilitator and inciter who provided financial support and ideological justification for Al-Qaida-affiliated groups seeking to commit acts of terrorism in Kuwait, Iraq, and elsewhere. Along with Jaber Abdallah Jaber Ahmad al-Jalahmah (QI.A.237.08) and Mubarak Mushakhas Sanad Mubarak al-Bathali (QI.A.238.08), Al-Ali also recruits radicals in Kuwait for terrorist activity, including for Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04). Al-Ali provided financial support for these recruits, including paying their travel expenses to Iraq. Al-Ali obtained much of this money from collections in his mosque. Al-Ali has supported every stage of the terrorist financing life-cycle, from financing terrorist groups and activity, to facilitating deadly attacks, and inciting others to join campaigns of violence.</p> <p>Evidence shows that Al-Ali's efforts to promote radical ideology include the provision of material support for terrorist organizations, including those in Iraq that are affiliated with Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01). </p> <p>Al-Ali was a religious leader and financier for a Kuwait-based terrorist cell that plotted to attack United States and Kuwaiti targets in early 2005. This Al-Qaida associated terrorist cell was under his ideological supervision. Al-Ali visited the group's terrorist camps in Kuwait, providing funds supporting acts of terrorism.</p> <p>In addition to financial and ideological support and recruitment, Al-Ali also provided opportunities for potential recruits to obtain training in explosives in 2004. He used his website to provide technical advice for making explosives, chemical, and biological weapons.</p> <p>In his role as a recruiter for terrorist organizations, Al-Ali has issued "fatwas" providing justification for acts of terrorism, including a fatwa endorsing suicide bombing operations and more specifically the flying of aircraft into targets during such operations. This fatwa sanctioned "the permissiveness, and sometimes necessity, of suicide operations on the conditions of crushing the enemy (or causing moral defeat to the enemy), to obtain victory." According to this fatwa, "in modern time(s) this can be accomplished through the modern means of bombing, or by bringing down an airplane on an important site that causes the enemy great casualties."</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04), listed on 18 October 2004<br> Mubarak Mushakhas Sanad Mubarak al-Bathali (QI.A. 238.08), listed on 16 January 2008<br> Jaber Abdallah Jaber Ahmad al-Jalahmah (QI.A 237.08), listed on 16 January 2008.</p>
