IBRAHIM HASSAN TALI AL-ASIRI</u></a></strong></p> <p><em>Date on which the narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the Committee's website</em>: 24 March 2011<br> <em>Date on which the narrative summary was updated: </em>3 February 2015<br> <br> </p> <p>Ibrahim Hassan Tali al-Asiri was listed on <strong>24 March 2011</strong> pursuant to paragraph 2 of resolution 1904 (2009) as being associated with Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden or the Taliban for "participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of", "recruiting for" and "otherwise supporting acts or activities of" Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) (QE.A.129.10).</p> <p><em>Additional information: </em></p> <p>Ibrahim Hassan Tali al-Asiri is an operative of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) (QE.A.129.10). Al-Asiri acts as the principal bomb maker for AQAP and is currently believed to be hiding in Yemen. </p> <p>Before joining AQAP, Al-Asiri was part of an Al-Qaida-affiliated (QE.A.4.01) terrorist cell in Saudi Arabia and was involved in planned bombings of oil facilities in the Kingdom. In 2006 Al-Asiri was arrested by the Saudi police and imprisoned for nine months for trying to enter Iraq to join a militant group there. Upon his release, Al-Asiri attempted to create a new militant cell inside Saudi Arabia; however, police raided its meeting place and six of his colleagues were killed while he and his brother Abdullah fled to Yemen. Soon afterwards, Al-Asiri joined AQAP and has continued to engage in terrorist activity. </p> <p>Al-Asiri encouraged his brother Abdullah to participate in AQAP activity. In August 2009, Abdullah carried out a suicide attack when he detonated a bomb concealed within his body with the intent to assassinate the Assistant Minister for Security Affairs of Saudi Arabia. Although the assassination attempt failed, the plot demonstrated a high level of sophistication on the part of AQAP. Ibrahim al-Asiri is credited with designing the bomb, which contained one pound of explosives. Later, AQAP released a video of Ibrahim al-Asiri and his brother Abdullah in which an AQAP commander stated that Ibrahim al-Asiri had also wanted to perpetrate a suicide attack but had to be kept behind to oversee the mission of Abdullah.</p> <p>A Saudi Arabian citizen, in 2009 Al-Asiri was added to the Saudi most wanted terrorist list, and an INTERPOL Orange Notice was distributed worldwide. The notice was submitted as a global alert and as a request to locate Al-Asiri who posed a dangerous threat, concerning terrorism-related activities including but not limited to those undertaken on behalf of AQAP.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) (QE.A.129.10), listed on 19 January 2010</p> <p>Nasir 'Abd-al-Karim 'Abdullah al-Wahishi (QI.A.274.10), listed on 19 January 2010<br> Said Ali al-Shihri (QI.A.275.10), listed on 19 January 2010<br> Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Rimi (QI.A.282.10), listed on 11 May 2010<br> Anwar Nasser Abdulla al-Aulaqi (QI.A.283.10), listed on 20 July 2010<br> Othman Ahmed Othman al-Ghamdi (QI.A.292.11), listed on 16 June 2011</p>
