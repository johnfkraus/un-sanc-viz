When viewed as a single entity, Al-Haramain was one of the principal NGOs active throughout the world providing support for the Al-Qaida network. Funding generally came from individual benefactors and special campaigns which targeted selected business entities around the world. </p> <p>The founder and former leader of Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, Aqeel Abdulaziz Aqeel al-Aqeel (QI.A.171.04), and the Al-Haramain branches in Bosnia and Herzegovina (QE.A.71.02), Somalia (QE.A.72.02), Indonesia (QE.A.103.04), Kenya (QE.A.105.04), Tanzania (QE.A.106.04), Pakistan (QE.A.104.04), Afghanistan (QE.A.110.04), Albania (QE.A.111.04), Bangladesh, Ethiopia (QE.A.113.04), the Netherlands (QE.A.114.04), the Union of the Comoros (QE.A.116.04) and the United States of America (QE.A.117.04) have provided financial, material, and/or technological support to the Al-Qaida network, including Jemaah Islamiyah (QE.J.92.02), Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QE.A.2.01), the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QE.A.3.01) and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QE.L.118.05).

The Bangladeshi national was arrested in early 1999 in India, carrying four pounds of explosives and five detonators. The terrorist suspect told the police that he intended to attack United States diplomatic missions in India. The suspect confessed to training in Al-Qaida terrorist camps in Afghanistan, where he met Usama bin Laden in 1994. The suspect first heard of plans for these attacks at the Al-Haramain office in Bangladesh.</p>  <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QE.A.2.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QE.A.3.01), listed on 6 October 2001 <br> Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation (QE.A.71.02), listed on 13 March 2002<br> Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation (Somalia) (QE.A.72.02), listed on 13 March 2002 <br> Jemaah Islamiyah (QE.J.92.02), listed on 25 October 2002<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Indonesia), (QE.A.103.04), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Pakistan) (QE.A.104.04), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramayn Foundation (Kenya) (QE.A.105.04), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramayn Foundation (Tanzania) (QE.A.106.04), listed on 26 January 2004<br> Al-Haramain: Afghanistan Branch (QE.A.110.04), listed on 6 July 2004 <br> Al-Haramain: Albania Branch (QE.A.111.04), listed on 6 July 2004 <br> Al-Haramain: Ethiopia Branch (QE.A.113.04), listed on 6 July 2004<br> Al-Haramain: The Netherlands Branch (QE.A.114.04), listed on 6 July 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (Union of the Comoros) (QE.A.116.04), listed on 28 September 2004<br> Al-Haramain Foundation (United States of America) (QE.A.117.04), listed on 28 September 2004<br> Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QE.L.118.05), listed on 2 May 2005</p> <p> Aqeel Abdulaziz Aqeel al-Aqeel (QI.A.171.04), listed on 6 July 2004 </p>
